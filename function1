# --- The Execution Logic (Add this part!) ---

# 1. Get the inputs from the user
revenue_input = float(input("What's the revenue? "))
cost_input = float(input("What's the cost? "))

# 2. Use your math logic
# Note: We can bypass the units_sold functions if you just want to input total revenue/cost directly
profit = revenue_input - cost_input

# 3. Handle the margin calculation with a safety check
if revenue_input > 0:
    margin = (profit / revenue_input) * 100
    # 4. Print the exact format you requested
    print(f"Profit: ${profit:,.2f} | Margin: {margin:.2f}%")
else:
    print("Invalid revenue.")
